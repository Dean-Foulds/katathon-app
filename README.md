Katathon site page for the protect species of the Ace Hotel.  Go team, thumb push ups all the way.

This is the temporary project in lieu of MERN which WILL be better.


Quick set up guide:

https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan

(Note only the rails and ruby setup - also install rails 5.0.0 not the one they suggest as rails 5 has the security features we want)

Once you have cloned the app run the following command:

bundle

If all is well run:

rails s

Goto localhost:3000

Any issues let me know.  Happy hacking!
